<h1>Shelly Cloud was shut down on March 31st, 2016</h1>

<p>
  Shelly Cloud was a Ruby application hosting service that makes your deployment painless.
</p>

<p>
  It gave high speed servers, really simple deployment and full control over
  the cloud layout. Shelly was easy to use and developer-centric. You could host a full
  stack application for just €20 per month.
</p>

<p>
  It was providing following services:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Support Ruby on Rails and any other Ruby framework through Rack</li>
  <li>Deployment using Git push</li>
  <li>PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Elasticsearch and Redis databases with automatic and free backups</li>
  <li>Local file storage with no extra setup required</li>
  <li>Available caching at HTTP level using Varnish and at application level with Memcached</li>
  <li>Custom cloud configuration using YAML file</li>
  <li>A great support team that can personally help you deploy to Shelly at no extra cost</li>
</ul>

<h2>Thank you!</h2>

<p>
  Shelly Cloud started in 2010 as an internal project of <a href="http://ragnarson.com">Ragnarson</a>,
  a Ruby consulting company we were working for. We built it to solve the problems we had
  when deploying apps that we built for our customers. In 2012 we decided
  to spin it off into a separate business. During this time we have learned a lot
  about building products, both from the technical and business perspectives. We
  did a lot of that learning on our own mistakes, and we did a few big things
  wrong.
</p>

<p>
  We would like to say thank you to everyone, for trust and being with us for
  years. Building Shelly Cloud wouldn't be possible without you. Sorry that we've
  failed your expectations, but it's time to move on.
</p>

<p>
  And we would also thank you everyone who was a part of our team in the past:
  Katarzyna Jarmołkowicz, Ignacy Kasperowicz, Dominik Koślin, Michał
  Kwiatkowski, Barbara Niewiadomska, Łukasz Piestrzeniewicz, Szymon Szypulski
  and Stanisław Tuszyński
